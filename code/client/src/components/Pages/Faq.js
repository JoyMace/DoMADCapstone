			<h2>How can I donate items?</h2>
			<br></br>
			<p> Your donation can be given directly to an individual or to a local organization or an actual DoMAD organization page.</p>
			<p> For example, if you are going to a country in Sub-Saharan Africa, you could bring a mosquito net to donate upon arrival.
			Alternatively, you could buy your donation item upon arrival at your destination to help support the local economy.</p>

			<h2>What kinds of items can I donate?</h2>
			<br></br>
			<p>DoMAD provides suggested items for travelers to donate at their travel destination.</p>  
			<p>In many parts of the developing world, items that are relatively inexpensive
			   for most international travelers such as soap, bandages, flashlights, tarps and reading glasses 
			are not readily available or affordable.</p>

			<h2>Why should I report a trip? </h2>
			<br></br>
			<p> By providing DoMAD with your donation details, we can see what is needed
			    where and use this data to encourage more travelers to donate, 
				plus provide easy ways for users to donate across the globe!
			</p>

			<section>
			<h2>How can I contribute to DoMAD? </h2>
			<br></br>
			<p> DoMAD does not ask for (or accept) monetary contributions – 
				we do ask you to share your travel experiences!</p>  
			<p>We need your donation ideas and experiences to inspire other travelers to give back when they travel. 
				Travelers are asked to rate their donation experience to help others identify most needed and appreciated items.
